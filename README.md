# Survival Tools

This repository contains a variety of R tools for survival analysis, which are described in each section.

## The Nelson-Aalen estimator

The Nelson-Aalen estimator is a non-parametric estimator of the cumulative hazard function. The following R Markdown illustrates 3 ways for obtaining this estimator for a sample containing right-censored observations.

## KMSim (R Package)

An R package for simulating times to event from a Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator of a survival function, based on a sample of times to event (either for the entire sample, a subgroup, or an individual).
